* For the implementation that me and my group reviewd  none of the new code snippet testswhere passed. As seen in the Junit tests all things neew code snippets failed.

* Question1: This test case was passed for my group's implementation For the reviewed code I believe that it would take alot of reworking and is not just a simple issue.
* Question2:This test case was passed for my group's implementation For the reviewed code I believe that it would take alot of reworking and is not just a simple issue. 
* Question3: For the third code snippet that we fialed i bielved if we included a coupels lins to take care of the spaces btween the pratheiss we could fix the issue. For the reviewed ode i bielve that it woudl take alot of reworkign and is not just a simple issue.
